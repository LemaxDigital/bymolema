This is a Development Test.

If I had more time I would improve the form validation with more error messages, e.g: Make sure that only numbers are entered for the  renewal number or to make sure that the ni number field has two letters at the beginning and one at the end.
I would also change my css to match more web browsers by using "em" instead of px.
