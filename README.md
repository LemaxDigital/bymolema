This is a Development Test.

If I had more time I would improve the form validation with more error messages, e.g: Make sure that only numbers are entered for the  renewal number or to make sure that has two letters at the beginning and one at the end.
I would also change my css to match more web browser compatibility e.g puppting "em" instead of px.
